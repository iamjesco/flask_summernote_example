## Summernote issues

* Still have not figured out how to update the Summernote text current workaround is to copy paste the whole textblock
* Posts will have to start with a block/paragraph of text. If the Feed posts are displaying a part of intro text
* Add only the jquery files to the index.html file. the ols Bootstrap version link will fuck with the BS5 one.
